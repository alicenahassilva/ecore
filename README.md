## Introduction

Hello!

The test cases for this exam were written in Java for the language, using JUnit as the testing framework, and some Page Object concepts to help achieving a better code visualization. 

For the structure, tests are divided in 2 packages/pages: __Login__ and __Invoices__. Each one has its own test case can one ore more PO.
To execute the tests in an Eclipse IDE, for example, you can click on `Run > Select the package/page` as shown below:
