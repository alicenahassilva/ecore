## Introduction

Hello!

On this repo you'll find three automated test cases. They were created based in a challenge sent by the Company.

Their structure is simple, they are divided in 2 packages/pages: __Login__ and __Invoices__. Each one has its own test case and one or more page objects.
To execute the tests in an Eclipse IDE, for example, you can click on `Run > Select the package/page` as shown below:

![Example](https://github.com/alicenahassilva/ecore/blob/master/exam/files/how_to_run.png)

Execution of the two pages should show 3 results, like this:

![Execution1](https://github.com/alicenahassilva/ecore/blob/master/exam/files/login_tc_result.png)


![Execution2](https://github.com/alicenahassilva/ecore/blob/master/exam/files/invoice_tc_result.png)


Any questions, please let me know.
Kindly regards.
